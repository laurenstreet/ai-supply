I'm seeing AI be categorized in different ways.  One common batch of subcategories within AI is:

AI: Programs with human reasoning skills
    - ML: can learn without explicit programming
        - DL: use of neural networks

Another common batch is:

[https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence]
1. Narrow AI: designed to perform a single task, e.g. voice recognition, playing games, recommendations, steering cars
2. General AI: an ability to understand and learn different tasks on a level of human intelligence
3. Super AI: superior to human intelligence

And another:

- Reactive machines
    - most basic
    - no knowledge of previous events
    - react to stimuli
    - perform tasks within a narrow scope
- Limited memory machines
    - limited understanding of past events
    - limited understand of world outside scope
    - e.g. self driving cars making turns, adjusting speed, etc.
- Theory of mind machines
    - early form of general artificial general intelligence
    - can create representations of world with an understanding of other entities
- Self-aware machines
    - truly human intelligence level AI - general AI

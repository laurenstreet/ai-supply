Some common stories are that the idea of AI began in the 1950s [[1]](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238?login=false) [[2]](https://aisb.org.uk/what-is-ai/), or actually long ago as seen in ancient myths [[3]](https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1848).  

## How intelligent is AI?

AI seems to be defined, more or less, as a program with any perceived intelligence, which encompasses quite a lot.  

A common way to categorize AI is by its performance related to humans [[4]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep12564):

1. Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI): designed to perform specific tasks, can potentially simulate or exceed human skill level but has narrow range of applicability related to humans
2. Artificial general intelligence (AGI): performs tasks on par with a human with the full range of applicability as humans
3. Artificial super intelligence (ASI): outperforms human level skills with a superior understanding compared to humans

ANI and AGI are also commonly broken down into further categories as [[5]](https://www.govtech.com/computing/understanding-the-four-types-of-artificial-intelligence.html#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20types%20of,of%20mind%20and%20self%2Dawareness.)

1. Reactive machines
    - Subset of ANI
    - No learning from previous actions, only reacts to stimuli
    - Example: IBM's chess playing AI, Deep Blue, made predictions for next possible moves, but didn't learn from past moves
2. Limited memory machines
    - Subset of ANI
    - Limited ability to learn from past events
    - Example: Self driving cars use a set of rules (e.g. knowledge of traffic signs) combined with observations of events in their enviroment (e.g. other cars around) to make decisions (e.g. steering and speed adjustment)
3. Theory of mind machines
    - Subset of ANI, almost AGI
    - Limited ability to learn from past events as well as to understand the desires of other entities and how they can be affected 
    - Example: Lack of benchmark tests [[6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11594) but possibly some large language models [[7]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083)
4. Self-aware machines
    - Truly AGI
    - Ability to learn from past events, to understand the desires of other entities and how they can be affected, and to understand themself
    - Example: None yet

## Categories of AI

Another common way to break down AI is through a hiercharical representation including the structures within AI:

## AI ethics

With the increase of AI in our everyday lives comes the onset of responsibilities that can either be taken or shunned.  Some recent and commonly cited ethical problems concern AI algorithms that can generate content like text, images, and audio.  This type of AI can be used to spread misinformation [[8]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00944), while the data these algorithms are trained on can lead to privacy concerns and potential theft of intellectual property [[9]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/09/chatgpt-lensa-ai-ethics/). Other potential ethical issues include biased algorithms due to poor training data, privacy and cybersecurity concerns for individuals with increasingly personalized online profiles (e.g. social media, digital goods and services), and the decline of human understanding in decision making processes as interactions between humans and the outside world become more automated [[10]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishatalagala/2022/05/31/ai-ethics-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/?sh=4ef0221a3537).
